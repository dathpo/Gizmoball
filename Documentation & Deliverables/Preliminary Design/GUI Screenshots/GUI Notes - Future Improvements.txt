Notes/ future improvements.


GUI


The GUI has currently been made by using GridLayout, this will likely change to GridBagLayout due to the right hand side options not displaying correctly with GridLayout.
The boxes to the right hand side of each button represent text boxes that will allow the user to change the Friction Gravity and size of the ball.


A separate text field may also be implemented, that will provide instructions for each button once clicked upon, to help the user build a game.
